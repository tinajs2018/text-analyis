Problem : Text analysis of the  Online  Store

Steps involved in solving the problem

Step 1: Import dataset with setting delimiter as ‘\t’ as columns are separated as tab space.
Step 2:Text Cleaning or Preprocessing.
    • Remove Punctuations, Numbers: Punctuations, Numbers don’t help much in processing the given text, if included, they will just increase the size of a bag of words that we will create as the last step and decrease the efficiency of an algorithm.
    • Stemming: Take roots of the word 
    • Convert each word into its lower case
Step3: Feature Engineering
 The available data contains only two columns text and label. In this section we will create some some additional features using these features. Following list explains different ideas for creating new features
step 4: Exploratory data analysis.
Step 5  Data visualization of the results
